## Features

### Detailed

Your Token will be fully compliant with the ERC20 definition and compatible with any ERC20 wallet all around the world. It will have a name, a symbol and a decimals amount.

### Burnable

Your Token can be burnt. It means that you can choose to reduce the circulating supply by destroying some of your tokens.

### Mintable

You will be able to generate tokens by minting them. Only token owner will be able to mint. You can also disable minting if you donâ€™t want to generate tokens anymore.

### Supply Type

#### 10k

Your token supply will be 10.000. The entire token supply will be generated during deploy and sent to Token Owner wallet. You can't increase or reduce supply later.

#### Fixed Supply

The entire token supply will be generated during deploy and sent to Token Owner wallet. You can't increase or reduce supply later.

#### Capped Supply

You can define an initial supply to sent to Token Owner's wallet. You can increase or reduce supply later by minting or burning tokens (if allowed). You won't be able to generate more tokens than the defined supply cap.

#### Unlimited Supply

You can define an initial supply to sent to Token Owner's wallet. You can increase or reduce supply later by minting or burning tokens (if allowed). You will be able to generate unlimited tokens without an upper limit.

### Transfer Type

#### Unstoppable

Everyone can always transfer his own tokens. Transfer can't be stopped.

#### Pausable

Token owner can stop token transfers. Useful for scenarios such as preventing trades until the end of an evaluation period, or having an emergency switch for freezing all token transfers in the event of a large bug.

### Access Type

#### None

Your Token doesn't need an access type because of there are not actions that needs privileges.

#### Ownable

Your Token will have an Owner. The account you use to deploy your Token will be owner by default and will be able to mint new tokens or call the finish minting function. You can transfer token ownership to addresses or Smart Contract.

#### Role Based

Your Token will have Roles. Accounts with "MINTER" role will be able to mint new tokens. Accounts with "ADMIN" role will be able to add or remove roles to minters or other admins. The account you use to deploy your Token will be ADMIN and MINTER by default. In addition your Token will have the Ownable behaviour too.

### ERC1363

The ERC1363 is an ERC20 compatible Token that can make a callback on the receiver contract to notify token transfers or token approvals.

### Token Recover

There are lots of tokens lost forever into Smart Contracts. It allows the contract owner to recover any ERC20 token sent into the contract for error.
