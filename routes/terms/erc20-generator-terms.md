## Terms of Use
ERC20 Token Generator is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed Smart Contracts to enable users to build their ERC20 Tokens.
The Smart Contracts, and the Site, are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "App".

::: warning DISCLAIMER
ERC20 Token Generator and its author are free of any liability regarding Tokens built using this App, and the use that is made of them. 
Tokens built on ERC20 Token Generator, their projects, their teams, their use of Token (as well as anything related to Token) are in no way connected to ERC20 Token Generator or its author.

ERC20 Token Generator's code is provided under MIT License. Anyone can use it as per their needs. 
The App's purpose is to make people able to tokenize their ideas without coding or paying large amounts for it. 
Source code is public and well tested and continuously updated to reduce risk of bugs and introduce language optimizations. 
Anyway the purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk. 
Before acquiring tokens, it is recommended to carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in Token owner's Conditions.
:::

### The App
To most easily use the App, you must first install a browser extension called MetaMask.
MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency.
You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask.
Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
We neither own nor control MetaMask, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. 
We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

### Fees and Payment
If you elect to build a ERC20 Token on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask.
We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse or refund any transactions.
With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.
Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.
In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of an amount of ETH of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). Commission will be publicly visible on the App confirmation page and in MetaMask confirmation popup.
You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment.
We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our App.

### Risks
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof.
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your ERC20 Token, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.
You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your ERC20-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
The App does not store, send, or receive ERC20. This is because ERC20 exists only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of ERC20 occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.
There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the ERC20s ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of ERC20s.
Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC20 standard.

### External Sites
The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users.
We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites.
Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.

### Changes to the Terms
We may make changes to the Terms from time to time.
Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.
If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.

### Changes to the App
We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.
